<h1>About party</h1>
<p>A birthday is the anniversary of the birth of a person, or figuratively of an institution. Birthdays of people are 
  celebrated in numerous cultures, often with birthday gifts, birthday cards, a birthday party, or a rite of passage.

  Many religions celebrate the birth of their founders or religious figures with special holidays (e.g. Christmas,
   Mawlid, Buddha's Birthday, and Krishna Janmashtami).
  
  There is a distinction between birthday and birthdate (also known as date of birth): the former, except for February 
  29, occurs each year (e.g. January 15), while the latter is the complete date when a person was born (e.g. January 15, 2001).</p>
